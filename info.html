        <h1>Information</h1>

        <h2>About the server</h2>
        <p>The Factions CMP (Creative Multi-player) community is a vibrant and welcoming group of Minecraft players
            brought together by a shared passion for creativity and collaborative building. Centered around the Factions
            CMP Minecraft server, this community thrives on imagination, teamwork, and artistic expression. Unlike
            traditional
            Minecraft factions servers that often emphasize competition or survival, Factions CMP is dedicated primarily
            to creative construction. The server invites players to either join existing factions or form their own,
            each typically unified by a distinct architectural style or creative theme.
            <br>
            Within this flexible and open environment, players are encouraged to explore different aesthetics and
            techniques. It's common for members to participate in multiple factions simultaneously, allowing them to
            collaborate with a variety of builders and experiment with a range of building styles. This approach keeps
            the experience fresh and engaging, preventing creative stagnation and offering endless opportunities for
            inspiration. Whether you're into medieval castles, futuristic cities, organic landscapes, or anything in
            between, the Factions CMP community provides a supportive space where your ideas can come to life alongside
            others who share your creative spirit.
        </p>
        <h2>How to join</h2>
        <p>To join the Factions CMP Minecraft community, you must first complete an application form, which can be found
            on the <a href="apply.html">Apply</a> page. This form will ask for your Minecraft username and basic contact
            information. You will also be required to answer several questions about your previous experiences on
            creative Minecraft servers.

            Once submitted, your application will be reviewed by an administrator. Please note that this review process
            may take between one to three weeks. After the review, an administrator will contact you to inform you of
            the outcome. If your application is successful, your Minecraft username will be confirmed, and you will
            receive an invitation to join the discord server.
        </p>
